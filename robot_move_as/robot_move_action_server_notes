robot-move action server notes:

write a fnc to remove a bad part from quality-sensor1 packing area

first try fetch part from:
  Q-sensor sensed relative pose;
  Q-sensor frame

then place it back again;

function "pick_part_fnc()"

goes to: 
bin_cruise_jspace_pose_
bin_hover_jspace_pose_
approach_pickup_jspace_pose_
pickup_jspace_pose_
moves down trying to grasp part

once part is grasped, moves:
approach_pickup_jspace_pose_
bin_hover_jspace_pose_

successfully ran:
rosrun shipment_filler shipment_filler_test_bad_part

which senses a bad part, approaches it, lifts it, moves to hover pose

WANT: new action-server fnc for:
  move_part_no_release(from_part,to_part);

  this fnc should:
   acquire a part from source;
   move the part to destination;
   return without releasing part from gripper

  will combine this with:
   sense if is bad part or not; (distinguish part held by gripper from others)
   if bad part, discard it and return "failed"
   if good part, release it and move to Q1 cruise pose  (via hover pose???)

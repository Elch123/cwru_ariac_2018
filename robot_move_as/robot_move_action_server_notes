robot-move action server notes:

write a fnc to remove a bad part from quality-sensor1 packing area

first try fetch part from:
  Q-sensor sensed relative pose;
  Q-sensor frame

then place it back again;

function "pick_part_fnc()"

goes to: 
bin_cruise_jspace_pose_
bin_hover_jspace_pose_
approach_pickup_jspace_pose_
pickup_jspace_pose_
moves down trying to grasp part

once part is grasped, moves:
approach_pickup_jspace_pose_
bin_hover_jspace_pose_

successfully ran:
rosrun shipment_filler shipment_filler_test_bad_part

which senses a bad part, approaches it, lifts it, moves to hover pose

CREATED: new action-server fnc for:
  move_part_no_release(from_part,to_part);

RobotMove.h functions:

  bool place_part_no_release(Part destination, double timeout = 0);
  bool discard_grasped_part_Q1(double timeout=0);
  bool discard_grasped_part_Q2(double timeout=0);

   acquire a part from source;
   move the part to destination;
   return without releasing part from gripper

  will combine this with:
   sense if is bad part or not; (distinguish part held by gripper from others)
   if bad part, discard it and return "failed"
   if good part, release it and move to Q1 cruise pose  (via hover pose???)

shipment filler:
  select source part
  select destination part (box coords)
  test if all poses reachable
  
TODO: modify moves s.t. always goes: cruise, hover, approach, grasp, approach, hover, cruise

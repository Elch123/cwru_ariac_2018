robot_move_as functions;


CODE: TO_PREDEFINED_POSE
fnc: built-in, switch on pose codes
behavior:
   move to one of N pre-defined poses, encoded in .action message
   includes bin cruise and hover poses, and qual-sensor cruise and hover poses
    as well as Q1 and Q2 discard poses

CODE: TO_CRUISE_POSE
fnc: built-in
behavior:
   looks at location code of source part
   looks up corresponding cruise pose for this location code
   moves robot there (jspace move)
 

CODE: PICK
fnc: pick_part_fnc(goal)
behavior:  
   responds to goal->sourcePart
   computes key jspace and IK poses
   moves to cruise pose
   moves to hover pose
   moves to approach pose
   moves to pickup pose
   enables gripper
   if not attached, moves down slowly seeking attachment
   moves to approach
   moves to hover
   (does  not move to safe cruise pose)
   returns UNREACHABLE, GRIPPER_FAULT, PART_DROPPED or NO_ERROR

CODE: PLACE_PART_NO_RELEASE
fnc: place_part_fnc_no_release(part), part = goal->targetPart
behavior: MUST PRE-POSITION TO DESTINATION CRUISE POSE FIRST
   moves to hover pose
   moves to approach pose
   moves to dropoff pose
   (does not release part)
   returns PART_DROPPED, UNREACHABLE, WRONG_PARAMETER, NO_ERROR

CODE: DISCARD_GRASPED_PART_Q1
fnc: in-line
behavior:  assumes bad part is grasped
   move to Q1 hover pose
   move to Q1 discard pose
   releases part

CODE: DISCARD_GRASPED_PART_Q2
   as above, but for Q2

CODE: RELEASE_PLACED_PART:
fnc: in-line
behavior:
   ASSUMES previously computed approach and hover poses
   cmd gripper release and wait for confirmation
   move to approach pose (previously computed)
   move to hover pose (previously computed)
   alt: COULD provide Part destination info and recompute depart and hover poses
